### What I learned

This was my first attempt at this challenge. I decided to keep it as simple as possible and use just html and CSS to make this work. Makings the best of the div element and positioning them using percentages to make it more dynamic from desktop to mobile.



```html

This is all the html I used. Short and sweet.
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="qr-image">
      <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
    </div>
    <div class="qr-text">
      <h3>
